# windows-usability --- Windows guide for []: power users

It's a hard to swallow pill, but we just need the good-old Windows
sometimes.  E.g. we need it for gaming, for citrix meetings, for
photoshop, for friends and family.

In this repo, we gather our knowledge about Windows and running
Windows easily on GNU/Linux.

## Subtopics

[passthrough](passthrough/): for gaming (or other high graphics
performance oriented tasks) it's now possible to pass through your
graphics card directly to a running windows VM.  It's hard to setup
first, but very useful later.  This tech can also be used to setup
very nice multi-user, multi-head workstations.

[dualboot](dualboot/): UEFI dual-booting, how?

[licensing](licensing/): what you need to know about Windows 10
licensing, and our experimental results related to different
situations.

[editions](editions/): do I need Pro?  Is Home enough?
