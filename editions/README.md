# Windows 10 editions

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10_editions#Comparison_chart

Important features for us that are only available in Pro:

  - BitLocker: LUKS-like solution,
  - Hpyer-V: KVM-like solution,
  - Joining Domain or Active Directory,
  - Remote Desktop host (Home is client only).

Since you can buy Windows Pro for ~CHF 3, I don't think it is worth
considering Home for CHF 2.5 anymore.

Maybe for relatives if they are paranoid about the CHF 3 version, and
want to buy on full retail price, then saving the CHF 100 difference
makes sense if they are not gonna use any of the features anyway.

There is no difference in stability, gaming or other applications
support level.  So feel free to go for the Home edition.
